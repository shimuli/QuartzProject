Quartz.NET is a powerful, open-source job scheduling library for .NET applications. It lets you schedule and run background tasks at specific times or intervals.

Think of it like a smart alarm clock for your app — but instead of waking you up, it runs code (like sending emails, SMS, cleaning up data, backing up a database, etc.).

🧰 What Can Quartz Do?
✅ Run tasks every X minutes/hours/days

✅ Run tasks at specific times (e.g., “every Monday at 8 AM”)

✅ Handle complex schedules using Cron expressions

✅ Persist scheduled jobs (using a database)

✅ Run multiple jobs in parallel

✅ Retry failed jobs

📦 Where Do You Use It?
In ASP.NET Core apps (as part of background services)

In console apps (like automation tools)

In microservices, APIs, or desktop apps that need time-based jobs
